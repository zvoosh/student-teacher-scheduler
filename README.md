## Project overview

**Student‑Teacher Scheduler** is a front-end application (React + Vite) intended to let teachers publish available time slots and students book sessions. It focuses on a minimal, practical UX for creating, viewing, and managing appointments.

This README assumes the repository contains a typical Vite + React project. If your project has a different setup (Next.js, plain React, or a backend), adapt the commands accordingly.

## Features

* Create and manage teacher and student accounts (UI flows)
* Teachers define available time slots
* Students browse availability and book sessions
* Basic conflict detection
* Cancel / reschedule bookings
* Responsive UI

## Tech stack

* React
* Vite
* JavaScript (or TypeScript if present)
* ESLint (optional)

## Prerequisites

* Node.js v16+
* npm or yarn

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zvoosh/student-teacher-scheduler.git
cd student-teacher-scheduler
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

3. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

Open the address shown by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

## Available scripts

Put these in `package.json` if they aren't already:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx"
  }
}
```

Adjust linters/build tools to match your project.

```

## Configuration

If your scheduler needs a backend, you can use environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add values like:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
```

Access these in code with `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`.

## Tips & suggestions

* If you have no backend yet, use a simple in-memory mock or `json-server` for prototyping:

  ```bash
  npm install -g json-server
  json-server --watch db.json --port 4000
  ```
* Add unit/component tests with Vitest or React Testing Library.
* Secure production API keys — do not commit `.env`.

*If you want, I can also generate a ready-to-paste `README.md` variant tailored to a specific stack (for example: React + Firebase, or Next.js + Express). Tell me which backend or auth system you're using and I’ll adapt it.*
